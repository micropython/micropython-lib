class Monotonic:
    """
    MicroPython replacement for time.monotonic suitable for timeouts & comparisons.
    """

    # CPython time.monotonic() â†’ float returns the value (in fractional seconds) of a monotonic clock,
    # i.e. a clock that cannot go backwards. The clock is not affected by system clock updates.
    # The reference point of the returned value is undefined, so that only the difference between the
    # results of two calls is valid.

    # Most micropython ports have single-precision float for size / efficiency reasons, and some do not have
    # float support at all in hardware (so are very slow).
    # To support measurements of difference between two time points, time.ticks_ms() and time.ticks.diff()
    # are generally recommended, however this can complicate efforts to port existing libraries using
    # time.monotonic.

    # This library is intended to support being used as a drop-in replacement for many/most use cases of
    # time.monotonic. It will wrap the ticks functions and handle/hide the 32-bit rollover handling.

    # Note however if you convert the output of monotonic to int or float, eg `float(monotonic())` then
    # comparisions between these value are not always valid becasuse they will wrap around back to zero
    # after a certain length of time. In other words, always do comparisons against the object returned
    # by monotonic() without type conversion.

    # See the test_monotonic.py unit test for examples of usage.
